My Take on Mary Rose Cook's Space Invaders
=================

As part of my [JavaScript The Good Parts](https://www.amazon.com/JavaScript-Good-Parts-Douglas-Crockford/dp/0596517742) book club [homework](https://nitalk.jiveon.com/docs/DOC-488887),

1. I typed out the Code from here: https://vimeo.com/105955605
2. I linted the code with JSLint
3. I also fixed an unhandled exception when playing in Chrome

**New in This Version** This bare-bones JS game supports Touch!
